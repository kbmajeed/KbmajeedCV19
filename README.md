## About Me
I am an ethusiast of Robotic and Intelligent Systems. Robots generally operate on the cycle of Sensing, Thinking and Acting. Over the years, I have garnered knowledge through practice and academic coursework of this cycle. I was exposed to signal processing and analysis during my undergraduate (EE) degree. In my first masters (SCE) degree, I specialized in dynamics and control theory which covers the acting region. My 2nd masters degree (CS) with a specialization in machine learning covers the thinking spectrum.
